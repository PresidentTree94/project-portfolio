# PresidentTree94 Developer Portfolio
A single-page application built with ReactJS and TypeScript that showcases my skills, education, and projects as a junior developer. This portfolio is designed with a nature-inspired theme, using a clean layout and a custom "leaf-score" rating system to visually represent my proficiency in various technologies.

## Features
- **Dynamic Skill Scores:** The "Skills" section dynamically generates a visual score using leaf icons based on local JSON data.
- **Education Timeline:** A list of academics, including the school, major, degree, and years.
- **Projects Showcase:** A dedicated section to highlight key projects, including screenshots, descriptions, technology icons, and links to live demos and GitHub repositories.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Skills
An assessment where skill levels is evaluated across five key criteria, with scores ranging from 0-2 points:
- **0 Points:** Foundational knowledge being developed
- **1 Point:** Actively learning and applying concepts
- **2 Points:** Confident mastery and practical application
